# Image-Style-Transfer
Remember using applications like Prisma, Snapseed, Lucid etc.? Ever wondered how these things works?

We give a photo from our camera roll, then we select a design to combine both the images and we get a resultant new image which has the **_content_** of our input image and **_style_** of the design image. In the world of deep learning this is called **Style transfer**

The **_style_** of a painting is: the way the painter used brush strokes; how these strokes form objects; texture of objects; color palette used.
The **_content_** of the image is what objects are present in this image (person, face, dog, eyes, etc.) and their relationships in space.
