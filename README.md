# Image-Style-Transfer
Remember using applications like Prisma, Snapseed, Lucid etc.? Ever wondered how these things works?

We give a photo from our camera roll, then we select a design to combine both the images and we get a resultant new image which has the content of our input image and style of the design image. In the world of deep learning this is called “Style transfer”

The style of a painting is: the way the painter used brush strokes; how these strokes form objects; texture of objects; color palette used.
The content of the image is what objects are present in this image (person, face, dog, eyes, etc.) and their relationships in space.
